### Summary

__Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, D3.js, Plotly.js, Leaflet, Dimple.js, NVD3.js, 
Flask with a SQLite database, and Heroku__, were used to build an interactive dashboard for 
exploring the National Household Survey 2017.

### Background

By 2050, the world’s urban population is expected to nearly double, making urbanization one
of the twenty-first century’s most transformative trends. Populations, economic activities, social
and cultural interactions, as well as environmental and humanitarian impacts, are increasingly
concentrated in cities, and this poses massive sustainability challenges in terms of housing,
infrastructure, basic services, food security, health, education, decent jobs, safety and natural
resources, among others.  

The Member States of the United Nations General Assembly decided to reinvigorate the global 
commitment to sustainable urbanization and to focus on the implementation of a New Urban Agenda.

One of the pledges included in this Agenda is promoting equitable and affordable access to 
sustainable basic physical and social infrastructure for all, without discrimination, 
including affordable serviced land, housing, modern and renewable energy, safe drinking water 
and sanitation, safe, nutritious and adequate food, waste disposal, sustainable mobility, 
health care and family planning, education, culture, and information and communications 
technologies.

### Rationale

The National Household Survey 2017 by INEGI seeks to collect data about living spaces features, 
socio-demographic profile of its occupants, as well as the availability of information 
technology and communications goods and services.

A Megalopolis is formed by large cities that are united geographically or administratively,
in these cities unparalleled political, social and financial power is present. They are
an important factor to promote economic growth and must be at the center of 
governmental decision making.
 
Our exploratory data analysis was focused on the survey results for the Megalopolis, integrated 
by the states of Hidalgo, Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, Queretaro, Tlaxcala and Mexico City.  

A survey, unlike a census, is applied to a population segment (sample) and is useful to make
a more detailed study about different topics of National interest. It is important to note
that the survey results are generalized to the entire population.

The sample includes the information gathered in 2017 for urban and rural areas, its target
was 64,000 living spaces and the total records for the Megalopolis is 12,295.
